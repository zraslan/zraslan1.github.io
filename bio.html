			<h3>Hello,</h3>
					
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio.</p>

				<p>I am a Geospatial Analyst with a specialization in interdisciplinary research and applied GIS. I created this portfolio to showcase examples of GIS projects I am or have been a part of, ranging from LLD Telecommunication Drafting to complex modeling for advanced spatial analysis. I have a diverse professional background in GIS which includes working with the Connecticut State Data Center/Map and Geographic Information Center, University of Connecticut’s Geomorphology and Earth Processes Research Team, Wesleyan University’s Critical Health and Social Ecology Lab, KLJ Engineering’s Telecommunication Division, and Massachusetts Development Finance Agency.</p>

				<p>In addition, I have been offering GIS and Digital Humanities tutoring services since 2013, founded a small Geospatial Consulting business (ClioGraphica) in 2015, and have been volunteering as a Mapper for the <a href="https://https://www.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> (HOT) since Spring 2023. <!--Cliographica is a mapping based research and development firm committed to supporting our community with innovative and interdisciplinary geographic information system solutions. We draw upon a mixture of GIS analytics, application development, and interdisciplinary research to address the needs of each client, relying on a combination of technical expertise and artistic creativity.--></p>

				<!--<p>“The ultimate objective of all Geospatial Intelligence is to produce knowledge upon which a decision maker can act.”</p>-->

				<!--<p>My most recent work has been with an Environmental Protection organization in northwestern Connecticut, the Housatonic Valley Association (HVA). As GIS Manager, I worked closely with clients on projects regarding geospatial analysis and map design. I also designed the departments internal  geographic information systems and maintain online GIS platforms and Web Mapping Services.</p>

				<p>In 2015 I graduated from the University of Connecticut earning a B.A. in History and GIS. While attending UConn I mainly studied applications of GIS in relation to historiography, digital humanities, and innovative Geospatial Data Analytics. My academic interests focus on geospatial and location intelligence, historical and computational research methods, and demographic modeling. I have worked as a Census and Geospatial Data Assistant for the Connecticut State Data Center and UConn Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center, enterprise GIS offices which provide geospatial services for university departments and state agencies. I am also committed to the study and wellbeing of our environment, especially with regard to our human history of interaction with it. During my employment with the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History I was able to help facilitate the enrollment of programs at the museum as a student administrator, and work side by side with the State Archeologist, Brian Jones, to design and create an online GIS platform capable of housing and interactively displaying State Archeologist data. While an undergraduate student, I was an active researcher in several departments at the University. Working as a GIS Analyst/LiDAR Specialist for the UConn Geomorphology and Earth Processes Research Team, I was able to implement cutting edge remote sensed data and geospatial technology to research historical human interaction with the northwestern Connecticut landscape. Virtual Hartford is a University research team which is committed the study of Hartford, CT via microhistories. As a Digital Humanities Researcher/GIS Specialist for Virtual Hartford I digitized, georeferenced, and organized historical geospatial data into a GIS for historical research purposes. I was awarded the UConn IDEA Grant to fund my Honors Thesis research – case study material based on VH member, <span><a href="http://omeka1.lib.uconn.edu/exhibits/show/public-playgrounds" target="_blank">Allison Horrocks</a></aspan>’, Virtual Hartford episode regarding the development of Parks and Recreation in early 20th century Hartford, CT. I am also proficient with HTML and CSS mark up languages and designed this online portfolio myself as an exhibit of my academic and professional experience. Along with this website, I store GIS data for download on GitHub - (Coming Soon).</p>

				<p>Studying history, especially historiography, has taught me to think and write critically about a given topic. Professor Daniel Little discusses methods of historical research in his publication, <span><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HistPhil" target="_blank">Philosophy of History</a></span>: "[T]he concept of historiography...involves the study and analysis of historical methods of research, inquiry, inference, and presentation..." Most importantly, I have been trained to study particular material, discern significant questions, gather and analyze sources to ground historical analysis, and to express my analysis in a way that is clear and simple.</p>

				<p>As a Geographic Information Systems minor I have studied geographic data analysis and the mapping interface of GIS software to analyze visual trends and dimensions of geospatial data. Cartography has been a central element of this degree, as map making is part of the analyzing process and is often part of the final presentation (such as static or interactive documents).</p>

				<p>My true focus has been Historical GIS; I have researched this emerging field deeply, eventually deciding to base my Honors Thesis on it. On the other hand, my true passion is being able to help my community and environment. I believe my education and work experience have prepared me to offer my skills as a GIS Analyst, Researcher/Analyst, and Cartographer in hopes of improving our understanding and relationship with the world around us.</p>-->
